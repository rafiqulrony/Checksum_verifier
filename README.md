Checksum_verifier (Checksum verifier project)

The user has to select a file from local file system, choose a cryptographic hash function from a menu and optionally provide a reference checksum of that file in accordance with the chosen hash function. The application runs a native system command to generate the current checksum of that file according to the user-selected hash function and verifies this checksum against the reference checksum and shows the verification result in detail. The reference checksum is not required to be provided if the user wants only to get the current checksum. The user can copy the checksums to clipboard for further use. The GUI is fairly obvious and all types of input validation are neatly performed too.

Used technology/language: Java

User interface is GUI (Java Swing).

This project was done using Eclipse.
